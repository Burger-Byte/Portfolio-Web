## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Burger-Byte/portfolio-web.git
   cd portfolio-web
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask app:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) depending on your environment.

## üê≥ Docker Setup

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t portfolio:latest .
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   - The app will be available on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS, if SSL certs are provided).
   - Environment variables and volumes are configured in `docker-compose.yaml`.

---

## üîí SSL & Production Deployment

- **SSL Certificates:**  
  Place your SSL certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourcoolendpointhere/` (or update `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` in your environment).
- **HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS Redirect:**  
  In production, the app automatically redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- **Health Check:**  
  The `/health` endpoint returns a JSON status for uptime monitoring.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD with GitHub Actions

- On every push to `main`, [deploy.yaml](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) will:
  1. Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
  2. Deploy the latest image to your server via Docker Compose.
  3. Run a health check to verify deployment.

---

## üîë Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see `docker-compose.yaml`):

- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key`
- `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` for HTTPS
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` for Docker Hub authentication

---

## üìÑ Customization

- **Profile & About Info:**  
  Update the `PORTFOLIO_DATA` dictionary in [`app.py`](app.py) for your name, title, links, and summary.
- **Projects:**  
  Add your projects to the relevant data structure and templates.
- **Styling:**  
  Modify CSS in `portfolio_base.html` or add static assets as needed.
