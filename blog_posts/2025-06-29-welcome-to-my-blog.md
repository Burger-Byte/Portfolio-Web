# Welcome to My Developer Blog

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm excited to finally launch this space where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge as I set out on this journey to build my future with tech and becoming awesome and hopefully help some of you on the way.

## What You Can Expect

On this blog, I'll be covering:

- **Software Development**: Best practices, patterns, and techniques I've learned
- **Technology Reviews**: My experiences with different tools and frameworks
- **Project Insights**: Lessons learned from real-world projects I am taking on
- **Career Development**: Tips for growing as a software engineer (or ones I found useful)

## My Background

As a software engineer, I've worked on everything from small startups to enterprises. I have had the opportunity to use a wide set of tools and applications, and now is my time to make my own. My goals I want to achieve for this:

- Learning new tech and methodologies
- Being able to break scary things into small bite size pieces so it's easy to understand
- Make some applications and tools
- Finish the projects I start
- Sharing my journey

## Code Examples I'll use

Here's a simple Python function I used recently:

```python
def calculate_performance_metrics(data):
    """Calculate basic performance metrics from dataset"""
    if not data:
        return None
    
    total = sum(data)
    average = total / len(data)
    maximum = max(data)
    minimum = min(data)
    
    return {
        'total': total,
        'average': round(average, 2),
        'max': maximum,
        'min': minimum,
        'count': len(data)
    }

### Example usage ###
metrics = calculate_performance_metrics([95, 87, 92, 89, 94])
print(f"Average performance: {metrics['average']}%")
```

## What's Next?

I'm planning to publish new posts regularly, covering topics like:

1. **Setting Up My First Python Web App**
2. **My First Fight with Docker (And How I Eventually Won)**
3. **Making My App Talk to the Real World (nginx and Me)**
5. **Hosting on a Raspberry Pi: Because Why Not?**

## Stay Connected

Thanks for visiting! I hope you'll find the content useful. Feel free to reach out through my [contact page](/contact) if you have any questions or topics you'd like me to cover.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
